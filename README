# Installation

foximg creates config files and other miscelanious files while running. I strongly reccomend to install this in its own seperate folder. For now I don't distribute packages for this project. Download the source code and build it yourself.

## Supported Platforms

| Windows | :heavy_check_mark: |

# Goals of the Project

foximg is in version 0.x. There's a lot of things missing until I believe it's stable or complete. I will try to actively use the issues page to document milestones and planned features.
The general goals I want to accomplish with this app are for it to be:
- Easy to use
- Fast
- Very customizable
- Relatively portable (Small install size)
- Pretty to look at (Clean UI)
